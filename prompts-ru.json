    "prompt": "I hope you assume that you are an IELTS writing examiner, and according to the IELTS judging criteria, give me a score according to the IELTS questions and corresponding answers I gave you, and give me the basis for scoring according to the IELTS writing scoring rules. In addition, please give me detailed revision comments and write a full-score model essay. The first question is: It is sometimes argued that too many students go to university, while others claim that a university education should be a universal right. Discuss both sides of the argument and give your own opinion. For this question, my answer Yes: In some advanced countries, it is not unusual for more than 50% of young adults to attend college or university. Critics, however, claim that many university courses are worthless and young people would be better off gaining skills in the workplace. In this essay, I will examine both sides of this argument and try to reach a conclusion. There are several reasons why young people today believe they have the right to a university education. First, growing prosperity in many parts of the world has increased the number of families with money to invest in their children's future. At the same time, falling births mean that one- or two-child families have become common, increasing the level of investment in each child. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that young people are willing to let their families support them until the age of 21 or 22. Furthermore, millions of new jobs have been created in knowledge industries, and these jobs are typically open only to university graduates.However, it often appears that graduates end up in occupations unrelated to their university studies. It is not uncommon for an English literature major to end up working in sales, or an engineering graduate to retrain as a teacher, for example. Some critics have suggested that young people are just delaying their entry into the workplace, rather than developing professional skills. Please give me the following content in turn: specific scores and scoring basis, article revision comments, and full-score model essays.\n"
